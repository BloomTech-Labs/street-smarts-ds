## Project Overview


[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/B5GkoOPo/labs-24-street-smarts)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Street-Smarts-Automotive-Data-5450e77cf0c44a218a4aa6d67ce889eb)

Street Smarts helps you discover the value and carbon emissions of your car, and compare it to other cars.

We use deep learning in our state-of-the-art machine learning model to predict current prices.

Unlike the dealers, we also display the carbon emissions for your car, so you can make a responsible purchase.

### How to connect to the data API


Our initial release canvases included a Flask API with dummy endpoints to Heroku, hosting a database on there as well.  
  
To access the version of the repo that was deployed to Heroku:  
clone the repo     
access our commit with:    
`git checkout 1ff857091d07a4e13455aeba0e7bc4b0137434be`  

https://streetsmartdummy.herokuapp.com/pred

Example Input:
```
{
	"make":"this is a test",
	"model": "ford",
	"year":1995,
	"fuel_type":"gas",
	"state":"CA",
	"mileage":100
}
```

Example Output:
```
{
    "cost_to_own": -14698.94,
    "predicted_CO2_emissions": 11,
    "predicted_gas_cost": 4399.88,
    "predicted_kWh": 205.37,
    "predicted_price": -20000
}
```

Our current FAST api is deployed on AWS with  easily accessed docs at:  

http://data.streetsmarts.online/docs

Input:
```{
miles_per_year: int = 15000,
num_years: int = 5,
gas_cost: int = 3,
electrical_cost: float = 0.12,
maintenance_cost_per_year: int = 1000,
make: str='Ford',
model: str='F150 Pickup 4WD',
year: int=2005,
odometer: int=99999
}
```

Output:  
```
{
  "car_price_prediction": 30655.23,
  "fuel_cost": 16071.43,
  "maintenance_cost": 1000,
  "five_year_cost_to_own": 47726.66,
  "co2_five_year_kgs": 47608.93,
