## Project Overview

Street Smarts helps you discover the value and carbon emissions of your car, and compare it to other cars.

We use deep learning in our state-of-the-art machine learning model to predict current prices.

Unlike the dealers, we also display the carbon emissions for your car, so you can make a responsible purchase.
